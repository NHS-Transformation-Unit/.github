## Our Mission

At the NHS Transformation Unit we work in partnership with our clients to transform care and health outcomes for people and communities, empowering change from within. We are proud to be part of the NHS because we are dedicated to making the public purse go further, by supporting organisations to deliver change which will provide safe, high-quality, reliable care.

## Analytics and Modelling

Good transformation and clinical re-design uses data-driven insight to underpin decision-making. Data interpretation should be accessible, easy to understand and clearly communicated. To support our clients we offer a range of analytics and modelling including:

* Demand and Capacity Modelling
* Pathway Modelling
* Population Health Analysis
* Geospatial Analysis
* Workforce Modelling

Take a look at the repositories to see examples of our work.
